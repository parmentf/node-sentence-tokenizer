# Sentence Tokenizer [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/parmentf/node-sentence-tokenizer.png)](http://travis-ci.org/parmentf/node-sentence-tokenizer) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sentence-tokenizer.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/sentence-tokenizer)

Tokenize paragraphs into sentences, and smaller tokens.

## Installation

Use [npm](http://npmjs.org):

```bash
npm install sentence-tokenizer
```

## How to

Require the module:

```js
var Tokenizer = require('sentence-tokenizer').Tokenizer;
```

Instanciate a tokenizer, with the name of the utterer:

```js
var tokenizer = new Tokenizer('Chuck');
```

Set the entry to work on:

```js
tokenizer.entry = "This is an entry. Possibly composed of several sentences.";
```

Get the sentences:

```js
console.log(tokenizer.sentences);
```

Which should produce:

```js
[ 'This is an entry.',
  'Possibly composed of several sentences.' ]
```

If you want word-level tokens, use:

```js
console.log(tokenizer.getTokens());
```

Yielding:

```js
[ 'This',
  'is',
  'an',
  'entry.' ]
```

To get the second sentence, use:

```js
console.log(tokenizer.getTokens(1));
```

## Warning

As this package is made for a [conversational bot](https://github.com/parmentf/node-ector), the Tokenizer class get two parameters (`username` and `botname`), which have default values (`Guy`, and `ECTOR`).

When these are present in the entry, they are replaced with `{botname}` and `{yourname}` respectively.
If you don't want to use this functionality, pass two unlikely parameters (`kjsdfgiurbybuq`, for example).
